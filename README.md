# APP_NAME_STR

The code is a simplified version of
https://github.com/devias-io/react-material-dashboard with typescript.


## Configure the app name

The "APP NAME STR" (with hyphens) can be replaced with the name of your
own app by running the following script.

```bash
./configure.sh my_new_app_name
```

## Install and run

After configuring the app name, install the dependencies and run it as
any other react app.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
